# Project: Predicting Boston Housing Prices
## Goal: Model Evaluation and Validation
## This report is a modified version of the 'Boston Housing' Udacity Project that is part of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program

The report is saved in an iPython Notebook format. To review it click on the [Boston_Housing.ipynb](./Boston_Housing.ipynb) file.

If you want to run the code in your computer you will need to follow the install and run instructions.

### Data

The modified Boston housing dataset consists of 490 data points, with each datapoint having 3 features. This dataset is a modified version of the Boston Housing dataset found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing).

**Features**  
1.  `RM`: average number of rooms per dwelling  
2. `LSTAT`: percentage of population considered lower status  
3. `PTRATIO`: pupil-student ratio by town  

**Target Variable**  
4. `MEDV`: median value of owner-occupied homes

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer and not the Python 3.x installer.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory that contains this README and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook boston_housing.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook boston_housing.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.
